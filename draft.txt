Urgent: Concerns Regarding Recent Notices and Termination Process

Dear [],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention some concerning issues I have encountered recently regarding notices generated for RTO/Absconding and the termination process.

I have received emails on my HCL mail ID regarding notices generated during a period when I did not have access to my account. Despite attempts to clarify with neighbors, it seems that posts were delivered, but unfortunately, due to my and my family relocation, I did not receive these notices on time.

Furthermore, I would like to address my recent absence from the office from 14th to 22nd March. While I acknowledge there may be compliance concerns, I was in the process of applying for leave before my account was seized without prior notice. Despite my attempts to contact HR, I did not receive a timely response until I escalated the matter via email.

Subsequently, I was summoned to the Magarpatta office and instructed to resign due to unspecified family/personal issues, without being given the opportunity to address or rectify any concerns. Additionally, I have not been given any projects despite expressing interest previously, and relocation requirements presented in December are not feasible for me given my date of joining, which can be verified with the onboarding team.

I am deeply disappointed by the lack of communication and transparency in these matters. Even in the absence of any wrongdoing, I find it unjust to be asked to resign abruptly and to learn that I will only receive basic pay for the next three months. I respectfully request that if immediate termination is necessary, I receive my full salary instead. Alternatively, I am willing to serve the notice period with full salary as per company policy.

I trust that you will address these concerns promptly and ensure fair treatment for all employees. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely









I have got mails on hcl mail id regarding notices generated for RTO/ Absconding in those days when I was not having access to my account. When I checked with neighbours they told that posts have came. But the thing is from past few months I don't reside at any of my previous addresses neither my family does. So, I have not go letters on time.

Adding to it I have done office frok 14th to 22nd March. I don't now the issue with the compliance but I did so I think notices generated for me are inappropriate. Whereas I was going to apply for leaves before that only my account was seized without any prior notice. Also on trying to connect HR he didn't respinded on time. After tring with few individuals when I asked on mail including everyone then I got response. I was called at Magarpatta office and directly asked to write down my resign on paper specifying the family/personal issues in letter. Even I have said that I was applying for a mail when all these occured. I was not even given opprtunity to change my DU. RM or PM never approached me for projects even when I had tried previously. In Dec RM had arranged call but they needed compulosry relocation that is not possible for me since my DOJ you can check with onboarding team. 

When I was not wrong then also without letting me know prior without even asking me these things have occured and I am really disappointed with the management. And even there was nothing then also I had shufted to Pune I had done expenses in another cuty leaving my family. And one fine day I am being called to resign directly without any initiamtion and valid points and coming to know I am getting only basic pay for 3 months ? Immediately I am not going to get any offer letter in my hand until 3 months I urged to pay my full salary if immediate termination is needed. If not I am ready to serve notice period with full salary.
